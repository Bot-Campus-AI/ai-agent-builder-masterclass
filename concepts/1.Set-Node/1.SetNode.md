## 🎯 **Goal**

How the **Set Node** can create or modify fields and pass them along the workflow.

## 🪜 **Step-by-Step Demo – Set Node**

### Step 1: Create a New Workflow

* Click **“New Workflow”** in n8n.
* Add a **Manual Trigger** (so you can run it instantly).

### Step 2: Add a Set Node

* After the trigger, drag in a **Set Node**.
* In the **Values to Set** section, add fields like:

  * **Field Name**: `status` → **Value**: `active`
  * **Field Name**: `score` → **Value**: `85`

### Step 3: Run the Workflow

* Click **Execute Workflow**.
* Show how the output now contains:

  ```json
  {
    "status": "active",
    "score": 85
  }
  ```

### Step 4: Modify Data

* Add another field:

  * **Field Name**: `fullName` → **Value**: `John Doe`
* Re-run and show how data grows step by step.

### Step 5: Pass Data Forward

* After Set, connect another node (e.g., **HTTP Request** or just another **Set Node**).
* Demonstrate how the data created here flows into the next node.

## 📝 **Key Takeaway for Students**

👉 **Set Node = scratchpad** where you can add, rename, or modify data before/after any other node.
👉 It’s one of the **most reusable blocks** across all automations.
